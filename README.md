# MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA VIZUALIZATION
### EDA - exploratory data analysis
Performs basic EDA on a dataset.
Dataset used is provided in the repository
### Regression
Several different models used to predict continuous data from the dataset ecommerce.csv<br/>
Topics covered:<br>
* Linear Regression<br>
* Batch Gradient Descent<br>
* Stochastic Gradient Descent<br>
* SGDRegressor (sklearn)<br>
* Regularization techniques<br>
### Clustering
First part of the project performa KMeans clustering on dataset hrdata3
<br/>Second part perform Agglomerative clustering on the same data<br/>
Some basic EDA is also performed on dataset
### NLP - natural language processing
First part of the project preform basic EDA on the dataset.<br/>
Then, the model is trained in two different ways. The predictions on whether the news are fake or real are formed based on the model.<br/>
Second part of the project is building a model that predicts the category of the news. <br/>
"news.csv" is a datasate of fake news and real news combined from [this website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=True.csv)
